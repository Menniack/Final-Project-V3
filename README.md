- USB-C cable to connect your headset to your PC

## How to Build and Launch

### In Unity...
1. Go to Build Profiles, under File.
2. Choose the corresponding profile for your platform, which is most likely Meta Quest or some other VR platform.
3. Be sure, in your scene list, the scene "BasicScene" is chosen. This is the scene in the video demonstration.
4. Choose any settings that feel comfortable, then build and run the app.

## Features
- Interactable bow and arrow in VR, with self-spawning arrows
- Arrows contain a "fire" effect at the tip
- Near-Far interactors, to grab the bow from far away
- Teleport functionality, continuous movement functionality, snap turn functionality
- Arrow sticks after shooting, to help simulate the feel of impact
- Sound for the bow
- Settings menu, with a "Reset scene" button

## Known Issues / Limitations
- Arrow will not stick correctly into the trees and rocks.
- Arrow will dissapear when being shot into the ground.
- Scene overall looks cheap.
- Arrow VFX can reduce clarity when aiming the bow.

## Future possibilities
- More robust feel of shooting
- Shooting range, complete with moving targets, score, and a timer
- Predictive line that shows where the arrow is going to travel, based on the pull of the string
